All notable changes to the MarketDataAPI project will be documented in this file.

## [2025-08-06] - Complete DatabaseFactory Elimination and Schema Mapper Updates

### Completed
- **Final DatabaseFactory cleanup** - Eliminated all remaining `DatabaseFactory` references across the entire codebase
- **Schema mapper modernization** - Updated `schema/schema_mapper.py` to use direct model imports instead of factory pattern
- **Route optimization** - Cleaned up `routes/schema.py` and `routes/transparency_routes.py` to remove factory dependencies
- **Alembic migration updates** - Fixed `alembic/env.py` to use direct model imports for proper metadata generation
- **SQL Server service finalization** - Completed transition of `services/sqlserver/instrument_service.py` to use direct database configuration

### Fixed
- **Schema type mapping** - `SchemaMapper._get_type_mapping()` now uses direct imports: `Instrument, Equity, Debt, Future`
- **Transparency route stability** - All three `DatabaseFactory` references in transparency routes replaced with direct model imports
- **Migration metadata** - Alembic now properly loads all models for complete schema metadata without factory dependencies

### Removed
- **All DatabaseFactory usage** - Zero remaining references in Python code (only documentation examples remain)
- **Factory complexity** - Eliminated the last instances of complex factory pattern usage for models

### Verified
- ✅ **Zero compilation errors** - All updated files pass syntax and import validation
- ✅ **Clean architecture** - Direct imports throughout with `ServicesFactory` preserved for database type switching
- ✅ **Migration readiness** - Alembic env.py properly configured with explicit model imports
- ✅ **Schema functionality** - Schema mapping and transformation capabilities fully preserved

### Architecture Status
- **Models**: 100% direct imports from `models.sqlite.*`
- **Services**: Database type switching via `ServicesFactory.get_*_service()`
- **Sessions**: Direct database instantiation via `DatabaseConfig.get_database_type()`
- **Migrations**: Explicit model imports in `alembic/env.py`
- **Routes**: Clean direct model access throughout API layer

## [2025-08-05] - Database Factory Pattern Cleanup and Architecture Simplification

### Simplified
- **Factory pattern optimization** - Removed complex `DatabaseFactory` in favor of direct model imports and cleaner session management
- **Session management refactoring** - Updated `database/session.py` to use direct database configuration instead of factory pattern
- **Import cleanup** - Migrated all routes and services from `DatabaseFactory.get_models()` to direct imports from `models.sqlite.*`

### Fixed  
- **SQLAlchemy mapper conflicts** - Resolved "mappers failed to initialize properly" errors by eliminating duplicate model definitions
- **Abstract class metaclass issues** - Fixed "abstract class error" by removing conflicting ABC patterns in model factory
- **Route functionality restoration** - All instrument search, admin pages, and API endpoints now work correctly

### Removed

  - `*.bak` model files - Backup models from migration period
  - Python cache directories (`__pycache__`) - Project-wide cleanup
- **Complex factory calls** - Replaced `DatabaseFactory.get_models()` with simple direct imports

### Maintained

- **Database interface** - Preserved `DatabaseInterface` for individual database implementations  
- **Configuration flexibility** - Environment-based database selection remains unchanged

### Technical Details
