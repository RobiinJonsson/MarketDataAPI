All notable changes to the MarketDataAPI project will be documented in this file.

## [2025-08-08] - Major Architecture: Unified Transparency Models + Critical Bug Fixes

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED TODAY - Unified Transparency Architecture
- **DATABASE MIGRATION**: Successfully applied Alembic migration for unified transparency schema
- **SESSION MANAGEMENT**: Fixed SQLAlchemy session issues with proper object detachment using `session.expunge()`
- **TESTING VALIDATION**: Verified unified architecture works with real FITRS data (US8793601050, DE000LB2CYH0, DE000C3QLC10)
- **CLEANUP**: Removed test files, debug scripts, and backup files
- **RESULT**: Fully functional unified transparency system replacing polymorphic inheritance

### üöÄ MAJOR ARCHITECTURE IMPROVEMENTS
- **Unified Transparency Models (FITRS)**
  - **ACHIEVEMENT**: Replaced complex polymorphic inheritance with unified JSON-based storage
  - **MIGRATION**: `TransparencyCalculation` + `EquityTransparency` + `NonEquityTransparency` + `DebtTransparency` + `FuturesTransparency` ‚Üí `TransparencyCalculation` + `TransparencyThreshold`
  - **ANALYSIS**: Comprehensive FITRS data structure analysis (FULECR_E, FULNCR_C, FULNCR_D, FULNCR_F) revealed unified patterns
  - **BENEFIT**: Single, flexible architecture handles all transparency file types with JSON storage
  - **PATTERN**: Applied same successful approach used for FIRDS unification

- **Simplified Transparency Service**
  - **MODERNIZED**: `TransparencyService` now uses unified models with automatic file type detection
  - **FEATURES**: Smart FITRS file type determination, flexible criteria extraction, normalized threshold management
  - **COMPATIBILITY**: Maintained same class names and interface for seamless migration
  - **BACKED UP**: Original files preserved as `.bak` files

### üêõ CRITICAL BUG FIXES
- **Fixed FIRDS File Corruption Issue**
  - **PROBLEM**: Files with `.csv` extensions were saved as binary pickle files but loaded as CSV, causing garbled data with "≈í" characters
  - **ROOT CAUSE**: Mismatch in `esma_utils.py` caching logic - saved with `df.to_pickle()` but loaded with `pd.read_csv()`
  - **SOLUTION**: Restored proper CSV handling logic from backup version
  - **IMPACT**: FIRDS F/D files now process correctly without corruption

- **Fixed Auto-Cleanup Logic**
  - **PROBLEM**: Auto-cleanup incorrectly used date configuration range to delete freshly downloaded files
  - **ROOT CAUSE**: Logic checked if files were within `start_date` to `end_date` range and deleted "out-of-range" files
  - **SOLUTION**: Removed date range filtering from auto-cleanup; now only keeps most recent file per pattern type
  - **IMPACT**: Newly downloaded files are preserved regardless of their date vs configuration

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Details
- **File Processing**: Fixed pickle/CSV format mismatch in caching system
- **Cleanup Logic**: Simplified to pattern-based retention (keep latest FULINS_F, FULINS_C, etc.) independent of date config
- **Date Configuration**: Now only used for download filtering, not cleanup decisions

## [2025-08-07] - MAJOR ARCHITECTURAL MIGRATION: Unified Document-Based Model

### üöÄ BREAKING CHANGES - Complete Architecture Overhaul
- **Migrated from Polymorphic Inheritance to Unified Document-Based Architecture**
  - **OLD**: Complex polymorphic inheritance with 5+ model classes, 120+ columns with extensive NULLs
  - **NEW**: Clean unified approach with 2 main models (Instrument, TradingVenue) using JSON storage
  - **RESULT**: Dramatically simplified codebase, better performance, handles any FIRDS file structure automatically

### üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema Changes
- **Fresh SQLite Schema** - Complete database wipe and rebuild with unified structure
  - `instruments` table: Core fields in dedicated columns, flexible data in `firds_data` and `processed_attributes` JSON
  - `trading_venues` table: All venue records stored in database with `venue_attributes` and `original_firds_record` JSON
  - **Performance**: Indexed core fields for fast queries, JSON for variable FIRDS attributes
  - **Migration**: `34a28fc2e575_initial_unified_schema.py` - Fresh start avoiding complex polymorphic migration

### üìä Service Layer Transformation
- **SqliteInstrumentService** - Completely rewritten for unified approach
  - **Database Storage**: ALL venue records now stored in database (not file-based access)
  - **Real FIRDS Processing**: Successfully tested with SE0000242455 (Swedbank AB) - 39 venue records

  - **Response Cleanup**: Added `_clean_json_attributes()` method removing NaN values and invalid JSON
  - **Consistent Serialization**: Unified response structure using model's `to_api_response()` methods
  - **Performance**: Database-first approach eliminates file I/O during API calls

### üöÄ Real-World Performance Results
- **SE0000242455 (Swedbank AB)**: ‚úÖ 39 venues, FIGI `BBG000BQXJJ1`, LEI `M312WZV08Y7LYUC71685` ‚Üí "Swedbank AB" (Sweden, ACTIVE)
